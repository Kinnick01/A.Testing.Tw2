# Jira-testing-TW-2

Team project, for simulationg bad tests.
The reasoning behind it, is to have a clear view of the differences between good tests, and bad ones.
We did not care about the quality.

After cloning the repository look around and check out the project, try to reconize why are these tests bad.
Here is another project where we have corrected the tests comapre these to the link->. https://github.com/BRreka/Jira-automation-TW3-Sprint1
